Welcome to my academic homepage! I am Kexin Zhao, currently pursuing my master's degree at Xi'an Jiaotong University, with a focus on the design and optimization of MHz fractional-turn transformers, power converter efficiency, and high-frequency applications. My work also extends into the exploration of wide bandgap (WBG) devices, magnetic core loss analysis, and piezoelectric components.

My research interests center on:
- Power electronics and high-power density converters
- Fractional-turn transformers and their terminations
- Wide bandgap devices (SiC, GaN) for high-efficiency applications
- ESR measurements and piezoelectric resonance
- Magnetic core loss analysis under high-frequency conditions
